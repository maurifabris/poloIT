Hello, my name is Mauricio, and I created this project, which is a simple list of companies that are part of the IT sector. It was developed as part of an acceleration program for job training.
It includes filters, CRUD for MongoDB, and mailing functionality.
For this project, I used Node.js, React.js, Vite, MongoDB, Mongoose, MongoCompass, Nodemailer, and more, with assistance from tutorials and documentation.

Thanks for reading.

(The passwords for MongoDB and Mailer are unique to the accounts created specifically for this project. I'll delete them once the corrections are made, as a security measure. If any service encounters an issue, make sure to use the password associated with another account when entering the parameters.)
